Enhance Gutenberg blocks with features such as icon, shadow, transform, transition, responsive typography, text alignment, hover style, etc.

== Description ==

Enhance Gutenberg blocks with practical features such as icon, color, shadow, transform, transition, responsive typography, responsive text alignment, hover style, CSS position.
Unlike other similar plugins, this plugin is fast, lightweight and clean. It only loads what you need. You can choose which features to apply to specific blocks through the settings page.

*It works with all themes, however, the with-icon feature uses the CSS pseudo `::before` to add icons with the `mask-image` CSS property. It may conflict with other plugins or themes that use the same technique.*

=== Key Features ===

* Add an icon to button, heading, list, list item, navigation, etc. from a library with more than 3000 icons, or upload your custom SVG image.
* Add box-shadow
* Add text-shadow
* Add 2D transform (translate, rotate, skew, scale)
* Add hover state style for shadow, transform, text-color, background-color
* Add responsive text alignment. It's useful for 'container' blocks such as 'core/group', 'core/columns', 'core/column' and/or you want for example text-align center on mobile but text-align left on the desktop
* Add transition
* Add responsive font size, font weight, line height, and letter spacing based on media queries
* Add CSS position

☐ More features will be added soon.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What problem does this plugin solve? =

It adds more features to make core blocks fit more real-world use cases.

= When should we use this plugin? =

When you want more advanced features on core blocks, but don’t want any third-party blocks from a heavy block library.

= Why do you need this plugin? =

It’s super easy to use and lightweight. It only loads what you need.

= Who needs this plugin? =

Anyone can use this plugin.

= Why does the text of the block break when I add an icon to it? =

It is probably because you added an inline element such as bold, italic, highlight, etc. in the text. To fix it, there is a toggle setting named ‘Don't wrap text across lines.’ in the ‘With icon’ panel. Just turn it on to make the text work properly.
